== Upgrading ==

The easiest way to upgrade to version 2.0 from previous versions is to deactivate the plugin in wordpress and delete the plugin folder from your web server.  Once the new plugin files have been uploaded and you have activated the plugin in wordpress then you have authorized the new plugin with flickr before you can use the plugin.  It is also suggested to update your options to resave the values in the database to make sure you have all the latest option values saved.

== Usage ==

After the plugin has been installed, activated, and the configuration options have been set you will 
be able to a simpleviewer object to you content with the `<simpleflickr>` tag.

`<simpleflickr set="72157594408754918" />`

Here is an example to show a group:
  
`<simpleflickr group="47755705@N00" />`
